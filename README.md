# 🎮 Simon Game

A web-based memory sequence game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — part of my Web Development learning journey.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Press any key to start the game.
- Watch the pattern shown (colors will flash).
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in order.
- Each level adds a new color to the pattern.
- Game over if you click the wrong color!

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)
